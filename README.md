# 📚 Library Management System

## 📖 Introduction
The **Library Management System** is a web-based application designed to help librarians manage their daily tasks efficiently. It replaces manual paperwork with a digital interface.
With this app, you can **add new books** to the library catalog and **issue books** to students. It uses **Local Storage**, so all your data is saved securely in the browser even if you refresh or close the page.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 📘 Book Management (Catalog)
* **Add Books:** Enter details like Title, Author, Year, Roll No, and Rack No.
* **View List:** See all available books in a clean table format.
* **Search:** Quickly find a book by typing its title or author name.
* **Edit/Delete:** Update book details or remove them from the library.

### 2. 🎓 Issue & Return System :-
* **Issue Books:** Assign books to students using their Name and Mobile Number.
* **Track Due Dates:** Set Issue Date and Due Date to keep track of returns.
* **Manage Records:** Edit or delete issue records when a book is returned.

### 3. 💾 Data Persistence :-
* **No Database Needed:** Uses browser **LocalStorage** to save all books and issue records permanently.
* **Auto-Save:** Data is saved automatically after every action.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used :-
* **HTML5:** For the structure of forms and tables.
* **CSS3:** For styling, responsive layout, and clean UI.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For logic, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and LocalStorage handling.

## 💡 Benefits of this Project :-

## 🔮 Future Scope
This project can be expanded in the future with these features:

1.  **Login System:** Add Admin and Student login panels.
2.  **Fine Calculator:** Automatically calculate fines if a student returns a book after the due date.
3.  **Real Database:** Connect with **MySQL or MongoDB** to store data on a server instead of the browser.
4.  **Barcode Scanner:** Use a scanner to add or issue books quickly.
